Pages in Octopress are by default appended with the .markdown extension. 

> Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can optionally be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. Markdown is popularly used as format for readme files, or for writing messages in online discussion forums.  - Wikipedia

Example - the .markdown that generated the resources list below consists of a ## and multiple - symbols. When converted to HTML the text to the right of the ## is placed in an h2 tag and the multiple lines prepended by the - symbol are converted into an unordered list.
